# dev-agents-harness

Shared Mistral Vibe agent harness for the dev team. Home of **Orion** (Software Architect) and future team agents (frontend, backend, security, SRE, etc.).

## Agents

| Agent | Role | Config |
|---|---|---|
| `orion` | Software Architect (DDD, security, performance, PM) | `.vibe/agents/orion.toml` |
| `orion-audit` | Read-only Orion for scheduled/audit jobs | `.vibe/agents/orion-audit.toml` |

Run locally after cloning:

```bash
git clone git@github-penny:pennydulum/dev-agents-harness.git
cd dev-agents-harness
vibe --agent orion
```

## Adding a new team agent

1. Copy `.vibe/agents/orion.toml` → `<name>.toml` (keep `agent_type = "agent"`).
2. Write the full system prompt → `.vibe/prompts/<name>.md`, reference it via `system_prompt_id`.
3. Add skills under `.vibe/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` (Agent Skills spec: YAML frontmatter + body).
4. Add a row to the Agents table above.
5. Update `AGENTS.md` only if the new agent changes rules for everyone.

## Layer separation (do not blur)

```
Agent prompt   = how to think
AGENTS.md      = how to operate in this repo
Skills         = how to perform repeatable tasks
Library        = what agents can look up
ADRs           = what we decided
Repository     = what actually exists
```
